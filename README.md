# developerNews.io
It is our effort to create the first mainstream and comprehensive news site for developers and software engineers and UI/UX designers. I said mainstream because the site will have proper editors who will write real articles and I am hopeful it will have a full staff. This is the goal anyway.

This project will be almost identical to BusinessInsider.com1 (in terms of the business model), except that DeveloperNews.io will of course focus on news and entertainment for software engineers, web developers, designers, UIUX developers, and other similar techies. We will add an Artificial Intelligence (AI) section to the site as well, even though it isn't current shown on the UI. The UI was completed many months ago, btw. Sam designed it.
